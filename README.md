# Kubernetes (k8s) homelab charts

These are the charts that I use in my homelab. Feel free to inspire yourself from them or fork them and modify them.

## Installation of the cluster

Please have a look at the main [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## Setting up an ingress with nginx

Please have a look at this [README.md](./ingress/README.md).

## Setting up one of the services

Navigate to the folder you are interested in, a README should be in there. If not, please raise an issue. Thanks.
